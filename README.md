## Description

The note taker app allows users to take notes and save them to a database and retrieve them when called. Their are two main html pages; first, the index that will bring you to the note taking area, then, users will create a note title and add notes in the text area. After clicking the save icon in the top right, the note is saved and displayed to the left of the active note area.

The server was set up using express. The routes, html and api, are located in the public file. These tell the server what to display based on the urlendcode.
